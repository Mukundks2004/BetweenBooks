A characteristic feature of being an IDeA cadet that is both good and bad is the fact that the subjects you choose to study are for the most part limited. Coming to the end of my second year, I have had the opportunity to make roughly ONE choice between studying stats or comp sci this summer. This has boosted my ability to rank these subjects impartially dramatically, and I hope that someone who is a little similar to me finds themselves reading this at a time they have to make a difficult decision and that the choice is made easier.

## The Critera

Rankings will be based on one thing, how much I enjoyed the subject. It is ultimately a nebulous and subjective metric but I will reveal it is composed of:
- How much I learnt (more learning = better)
- How fun it was
- How hard it is (harder = better, although I have a big ego and I'll never admit anything was hard)
- How well it was taught- points for both the tutor and lecturer

Unlike my Lana Del Rey ranking, we'll start at the best and work our way down. Without further ado, I present a list of all first and second year IDeA cadet subjects ranked!

## 1. Network Fundamentals

This one shocked my friends especially since I complained about it so much in the moment. I found the tutor annoying and he was a little bit too controlling for my liking as he would point at us to answer in front of the class or ask us to avoid going on our devices. Not an irredeemably quality and I'm conservative with teaching styles myself, but his actual unfamiliarity with the subject and the way he kept alternating between strict and too friendly put me off. I also found the lecturer shockingly cold and dry, he would go through the slides in a monotone voice and when I missed a quiz he declined my request to have an extension (I know he's within his rights to do that but the only other time that's happened to me the teacher was super sympathetic and that raised my standards). This put me in a shit mood every class. I also had personal reasons, as I deliberately took a class my friends weren't in so I could continue my sports class on Wednesday evening. Later that week I ended up swapping over to Wednesday, but deliberately avoided my friends so I could branch out more and meet new people (some advice: generally don't do this, it's usually not worth it). However, I found some friends in the class anyway and sure enough ended up with them. This turned out to be a terrible decision as both friends stopped coming to class which meant I was often on my own. With our friendly not-friendly tutor.

It took me a second to take a step back and evaluate this subject objectively before I realised how good a thing this subject was for me. To start with, the subject gave me the push I needed and set aside time every week for me to *have* to be face to face with networking content. As much as I say you can learn technical stuff on your own, if you literally know nothing going to class is such an amazing chance to at least put the big words in your head to go and research in your own time. Words like TCP, Websockets, Router and Ethernet. It turns out I knew nothing and class doesn't just put the words in your head, it's been crafted to actually teach you the content.

And the content was difficult! It's hard to compare it to math and programming which are not inherently linear but are far more linear than networking, but I found myself learning so much about so many different things in the subject of networking. The textbook referenced many times was not mandatory, but the fact that a reference textbook existed was already impressive. Many of the concepts were tested, but many weren't and if I were to improve the subject I would make the tests in-person and much more rigorous. This feeling is pretty standard across all subjects, so feel free to apply it in your head even when I don't say it.

Despite being objectively not fun, and being taught pretty poorly (did I mention the tutor was caught out by my questions on more than one occasion), I got such a good basic understanding of the subject fundamentals my productivity at work doubled. If the head of the cadetship is reading this, you have to include networking in the training- students will be helpless without it. This makes Net Funds the most useful subject I have taken to date.

## 2. Application Development with .NET

This one's also a bit odd. I think the subject has great sentimental value to me as I had to attend class alongside my entire cohort at the same set times twice a week. Twice a week? I forgot to mention I took this subject in the space of 5 weeks in the bonus winter semester that few students get to experience. The reason this subject rates so highly is because building the softwares for the assignments- especially the second assignment which is basically a free for all-  was incredibly fun. We partnered up with the cohort beneath us and I got paired with fantastic students that I had actually previously tutored. The assignments were easy and we made something cool and we loved it.

I also enjoyed how rigorous the subject was. I actually learnt next to nothing from the .NET content since I program in .NET for a living (I did learn a ton from one lecture... my own! I got to prepare a guest lecture, and a couple of my friends did too. I'm guessing because whoever was originally going to deliver it was double booked. It was on microservices with Docker and Kubernetes). It went through everything (most things), from the very basics of variables and logical flow to more complex features such as pointer manipulation with `unsafe`, how asynchronous programming works under the hood and the strengths and failings of the type inference system.

If I hadn't invested so much time in .NET, the subject would have been invaluable and I truly recommend this subject to any aspiring .NET devs. Set your sights high with the assignments! I originally intended to make an entire block-based programming language like *Scratch*, but not wanting to put the burden on my team I opted for a much simpler homework assistance tool. I implemented cool features like ability to parse mathematical expressions for validity, format latex for them on-the-fly and display it in WPF, and dynamically inspect DLLs for logic that was then processed and incorporated into a calculator app as a function with its own latex.

## 3. Database Fundamentals

Think of a weaker version of a combination of .NET and net funds, just as valuable because I actually didn't know much about SQL prior to the subject.

## 4. Web Systems

I'm putting this subject so high because of its *potential* to be super valuable to students. This subject just covered so many different things that it gives students a footing to choose what they want to do in their degree. Similar to networking, it just puts all the right words in your head for you to go away and learn *for real*. The course included content from these areas:
- Computer hardware, how memory physically works
- Operating systems, the kernel, file systems + storage
    - Linux, history and how to use it, linux scripting
- The web, the internet, protocols, and email
    - Programming in HTML + aesthetics and CSS
- Logic -> binary and truth tables

Man, what a combination! It really gives you a good feel for various computer-adjacent fields, including networking, linux, computer engineering, frontend design (sort of) and math (not really). It had an exam, which was actually fun to study for and sit! The exam was a skills test and was based around our ability to use linux commands to complete tasks like performing matches on files and copying the results to all other files that have a certain extension and whose names contain a substring. There were some small canva quizzes. And an assignment where we had to design and build a webpage (rookie stuff I know). All in all, a great subject in terms of how much you will enjoy it + got to go out for pancakes after class.

## 5. Communications for IT Professionals

This one has a special place in my heart because class was so fun. In terms of content it sucked horribly, but I learnt a lot from taking the subject about uni in general. Granted, that isn't specific to this subject but for me it was a game changer, and the structure of it helped a lot for me to do things like: find new friends, form groups, learn how to distribute workloads, learn how to take on responsibility, preparing for failure, timelineing with strangers. All stuff I'd done in HS but not in a "high-stakes" (I thought it was at the time) scenario and not with strangers. The in-person presentation forces you to come to class and also meet with your groupmates outside, since when else are you gonna prepare? The massive 180 minute labs give you this awesome high as you leave, having conquered the unconquerable. The lecturers were pretty good, they all spoke English fluently (it was a requirement I think) and were generally quite engaging (with an exception or two). There were 5-6 of them, taking turns teaching the entire class of 100+, which was a model that imo worked quite well.

We went over things like stakeholders and design, which I guess was sort of useful but I still would have liked to do something more techy instead. Assessments consisted of reports, prototypes and the previously mentioned presentation (which we smashed). Wasn't for me personally, but I put up with it. Stakeholder analysis is boring man, but you gotta learn to do it at some point.

Also, we totally partied in class. Aside from the 10 minute break in which we would sprint to central to get drinks and sprint back (again, first semester, wanted to be on time) we had epic parties after class. Class finished at 9pm on a Tuesday and honestly who- apart from us- would stick around for that? So the class filtered out leaving us the entire floor at the top of building 2.

![Room in building 2](/assets/img/citp_room.png)

The single room was split across 2 levels, surrounded by screens that would drop down on command. We (my team) would dim the lights, turn the music up and use the 8 or so mics spread around the room to do awesome 6 person simul karaoke. With food, drinks, and a free Wednesday morning, it was a pretty awesome start to my first sem.

## 6. Data Structures and Algorithms

DSA was awful and too easy

## 7. Programming 2

Too easy

## 8. Programming 1

Too easy

## 9. Discrete Math

The first maths subject on the list and it's in the bottom 5- did I make a mistake?

No. As I explained to my friends, I'm not grading the discipline inherently but the subject I sat at UTS, and maths subjects are naturally disadvantaged because I'll find them easier and therefore less exclusive and also less rigorous than I would like, pushing them down the chain.

The professor constantly alluding to more complex ideas and proofs but refraining to go into detail and the tutor who was pedantic about the things he had been told to be pedantic about and nothing else made a nice pair. It's almost as if every week he was looking for a use of induction that would forget the base case, without even bothering to think about how semantic descriptions of sets are non rigourous.

I loved how the subject firstly *forced* us to firstly be there in person as we had quizzes every second week. Secondly, that it rewarded a good understanding of maths since we had to demonstrate working on the board. It would be better if it required proofs in front of the tutor instead of just writing a single line on the board and pondering to get the attendence marks. Thirdly, that the tasks were non trivial. I thought they were easy in the moment, but in retrospect it was about the hardest any type of technical assessment got, aside from the bonus questions in prog 2.

Next time make the subject content harded, make the exams larger, more frequent and more difficult, include all the theory of comp sci content and make a score of 100% inaccessible to everyone except those that are able to prove some ridiculous lemma or demonstrate extensive prior knoweledge in the subject.

## 10. Theory of Computer Science

I consider this Discrete's annoying little brother. The content featured in this subject should have been included almost entirely in Discrete like in the UNSW course. The subject should have been expanded to complexity theory and other more advanced conepts. The assignments look easy. I'm only 2 weeks into this subject, so I'm rating it prematurely based on Discrete.

## 11. Software Architecture

I am strongly of the opinion that the subjects that are the most value are not the easy ones (of course not), or the technical ones (you can learn that on your own), or the hard ones (again, on your own) but a rare combination of practical and experience-oriented subjects that you just cannot learn to do "the right way" at home with a laptop. Arch is one of those.

In Arch you learn the big buzzwords that people toss around like "Data Lake" and "SaaS". These mean real things and it is important how they integrate into real enterprise solutions, because at work I've learnt you can never have an application- even one as simple as a scheduled task script- without thinking about how it will have to interact with users and services in the long term.

Despite its praise, I found the subject poorly structured and delivered. Neither the lecturer not tutor were particularly engaged, and its hard to find beauty in architecture the way people find beauty in philosophy or math.


Stupid, needs to be in person. maybe bad wrap.

## 12. Business Requirmenets Modelling

Funny story about this one. I was talking to my work friends about the most useful and least useful subjects they did (in their opinion), an example of a horrible one being BRM. My team lead at the time interrupts asking what we're talking about, and when we pose to him the question he immediately replied with the same subject- but for him, it was the most useful. This is a 60+ year old man who joined the industry long before I was born. His POV was that it gives you an excellent foundation for using previously acquired skillsets for scoping business rules and laying the foundation for information systems to be developed- indeed, it can be considered a derivative of InfoSys (the course, not the company). Why then is it so far down?

Well for starters I had a bad time. Taking it in sem 1 and being too dumb to link up with my HS friends already put me on a failing trajectory in this regard. My team was cool but we never clicked, and that already made me sour since my friends were having amazing times with their newfound uni groups. I also found the content boring, as every lecture slide felt simple and obvious, totally undeserving of an explanation (something like: "you must talk to stakeholders to identify their needs") but by the time we got to the in-class labs I was totally lost.

Let me analyse this subject a little objectively. UTS for some ridiculous reason does not have DB Funds as a prereq for this subject where more than half the terminology is derived from relational databases. Terms like "primary key" and "ERD" were tossed around with no context and I felt so bad about asking, so I just sat quiet and absorbed whatever I did and missed the rest. In retrospect, I should have been a better learner or just sucked it up and asked and I feel horribly ashamed that I was/did neither. Please always ask. Also, I have never ever had a situation where content has been assumed that was legitimately not covered. I see and hear people complain about it, and I see stuff like this:

![This never happens](/assets/img/kermit_forgot_the_content.png)

posted everywhere although I have experienced it NEVER. It usually goes the opposite ways- vectors for example were taught to me in Advanced, Ext and Ext II Math independently, and also Phys and Chem and Engineering. It was never assumed. In uni we've been over basic programming concepts in Prog 1, 2, DSA and .NET. This has gotta be the single exception to the rule. Although maybe it had something to do with IDeA cadetship interfering with prereqs, it shouldn't be allowed to happen.

The other problem is this subject introduces (what to me are) high level concepts very early in a CS degree. This one could be me, again a rare moment when I acknowledge this might be wrong, but the same way software architecture only makes sense after you've built a software business requirements only makes sense after you've seen a consultation, or understood what business rules are for and why it is so important to communicate with stakeholders. Trust me, you don't get it until you've tried it.

A lot of this talk hasn't been about my experience in the subject- it was dry and boring. Our tutor wasn't great, she wasn't able to adequately teach many of us. The assessments were not my style, mostly reports and diagrams. So many diagrams. Use case diagrams, ERDs, class diagrams, DFDs, state diagrams, UML. Definitely requires finesse to teach, and I've made a special point in my head to come back to it later. I still believe it is important, although 100% not up my alley, and students retain access to old canvas subjects even after semester.

## 13. Fundamentals of Interaction Design

They say that designers get paid a ton in the industry. They say that a lot of technically competent developers shy away from the creative and subjective aspects of the job, such as design due to its difficulty. I say it's ridiculous that people need professional qualifications to decide that light blue is nicer to look at than dark blue.

In Funds UI just about the only valuable thing I learnt is that a knee-high extended rigid surface is 'sit-on-able' and I quote that shit 4 times a week.

In this class, students waste time as the PhD who can barely string together a grammatically correct sentence in English reads from the slide, occasionally varying his pace and straying from the content of the slides maybe twice over the entire hour. By the time your ten minutes of 'Assignment time' are over you would have questioned if the nintey minute trek out to the city was worth it like 8 different times.

The lectures are equally painful to sit through. It doesn't help that the lecturer is a constantly unenthused and taking breaks from the content which is dry, repetitive, and painfully common sense to talk about his latest modern art project. Although in his defense, I would also do anything I could to avoid explaining for the 18th fucking time what the Nielsen Heuristics are.

The assessments are marked so incredibly harshly. Two of my friends who have no problems writing reports or otherwise engaging in non-developer activities barely passed this subject with low 60s. I remember their warnings to us as they received their grades to take it more seriously than they did. But it is hard to! Between exams with drawing components, canva posters and possibly the worst university assignment I have done to date- a massive report, composed with a storyboard, 10 figma wireframe screens on a paper prototype, a 5 minute video of a user interacting with the app followed by a lengthy analysis of the interactiveness and a redrawing of the prototype. Keep in mind, unlike technical subjects merely completing the task is no guarantee you'll be getting decent marks. That's judged by the *quality of the report*, which is a euphemism for saying it'll be copied and pasted into Chat-GPT. The assessments will make you paranoid about things you didnt believe it was possible to be paranoid about, how big an image is when you put it on a poster.

Altogether the combination of a lack of interesting content, an insane marking criteria, and no effort from the tutor's side landed this subject the rank it did.
