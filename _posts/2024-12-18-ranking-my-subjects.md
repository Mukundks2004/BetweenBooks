A characteristic feature of being an IDeA cadet that is both good and bad is the fact that the subjects you choose to study are for the most part limited. Coming to the end of my second year, I have had the opportunity to make roughly ONE choice between studying stats or comp sci this summer. This has boosted my ability to rank these subjects impartially dramatically, and I hope that someone who is a little similar to me finds themselves reading this at a time they have to make a difficult decision and that the choice is made easier.

## The Critera

Rankings will be based on one thing, how much I enjoyed the subject. It is ultimately a nebulous and subjective metric but I will reveal it is composed of:
- How much I learnt (more learning = better)
- How fun it was
- How hard it is (harder = better, although I have a big ego and I'll never admit anything was hard)
- How well it was taught- points for both the tutor and lecturer

Unlike my Lana Del Rey ranking, we'll start at the best and work our way down. Without further ado, I present a list of all first and second year IDeA cadet subjects ranked!

## 1. Network Fundamentals

This one shocked my friends especially since I complained about it so much in the moment. I found the tutor annoying and he was a little bit too controlling for my liking as he would point at us to answer in front of the class or ask us to avoid going on our devices. Not an irredeemably quality and I'm conservative with teaching styles myself, but his actual unfamiliarity with the subject and the way he kept alternating between strict and too friendly put me off. I also found the lecturer shockingly cold and dry, he would go through the slides in a monotone voice and when I missed a quiz he declined my request to have an extension (I know he's within his rights to do that but the only other time that's happened to me the teacher was super sympathetic and that raised my standards). This put me in a shit mood every class. I also had personal reasons, as I deliberately took a class my friends weren't in so I could continue my sports class on Wednesday evening. Later that week I ended up swapping over to Wednesday, but deliberately avoided my friends so I could branch out more and meet new people (some advice: generally don't do this, it's usually not worth it). However, I found some friends in the class anyway and sure enough ended up with them. This turned out to be a terrible decision as both friends stopped coming to class which meant I was often on my own. With our friendly not-friendly tutor.

It took me a second to take a step back and evaluate this subject objectively before I realised how good a thing this subject was for me. To start with, the subject gave me the push I needed and set aside time every week for me to *have* to be face to face with networking content. As much as I say you can learn technical stuff on your own, if you literally know nothing going to class is such an amazing chance to at least put the big words in your head to go and research in your own time. Words like TCP, Websockets, Router and Ethernet. It turns out I knew nothing and class doesn't just put the words in your head, it's been crafted to actually teach you the content.

And the content was difficult! It's hard to compare it to math and programming which are not inherently linear but are far more linear than networking, but I found myself learning so much about so many different things in the subject of networking. The textbook referenced many times was not mandatory, but the fact that a reference textbook existed was already impressive. Many of the concepts were tested, but many weren't and if I were to improve the subject I would make the tests in-person and much more rigorous. This feeling is pretty standard across all subjects, so feel free to apply it in your head even when I don't say it.

Despite being objectively not fun, and being taught pretty poorly (did I mention the tutor was caught out by my questions on more than one occasion), I got such a good basic understanding of the subject fundamentals my productivity at work doubled. If the head of the cadetship is reading this, you have to include networking in the training- students will be helpless without it. This makes Net Funds the most useful subject I have taken to date.

## 2. Application Development with .NET

This one's also a bit odd. I think the subject has great sentimental value to me as I had to attend class alongside my entire cohort at the same set times twice a week. Twice a week? I forgot to mention I took this subject in the space of 5 weeks in the bonus winter semester that few students get to experience. The reason this subject rates so highly is because building the softwares for the assignments- especially the second assignment which is basically a free for all-  was incredibly fun. We partnered up with the cohort beneath us and I got paired with fantastic students that I had actually previously tutored. The assignments were easy and we made something cool and we loved it.

I also enjoyed how rigorous the subject was. I actually learnt next to nothing from the .NET content since I program in .NET for a living (I did learn a ton from one lecture... my own! I got to prepare a guest lecture, and a couple of my friends did too. I'm guessing because whoever was originally going to deliver it was double booked. It was on microservices with Docker and Kubernetes). It went through everything, from the very basics of variables and logical flow to more complex features such as pointer manipulation with `unsafe`, how asynchronous programming works under the hood and the strengths and failings of the type inference system.

If I hadn't invested so much time in .NET, the subject would have been invaluable and I truly recommend this subject to any aspiring .NET devs. Set your sights with the assignments high! I originally intended to make an entire block-based programming language like *Scratch*, but not wanting to put the burden on my team I opted for a much simpler homework assistance tool. I implemented cool features like ability to parse mathematical expressions for validity, format latex for them on-the-fly and display it in WPF, and dynamically inspect DLLs for logic that was then processed and incorporated into a calculator app as a function with its own latex.

## 3. Database Fundamentals

Think of a weaker version of a combination of .NET and Net Funds, just as valuable because I actually didn't know much about SQL prior to the subject.

## 4. Web Systems

I'm putting this subject so high because of its *potential* to be super valuable to students. This subject just covered so many different things

## 5. Communications for IT Professionals

Partied, subject itself kind of sucked but maybe this one for non techs?

## 6. Data Structures and Algorithms

DSA was awful and too easy

## 7. Programming 2

Too easy

## 8. Programming 1

Too easy

## 9. Discrete Math

The first maths subject on the list and it's in the bottom 5- did I make a mistake?

No. As I explained to my friends, I'm not grading the discipline inherently but the subject I sat at UTS, and maths subjects are naturally disadvantaged because I'll find them easier and therefore less exclusive and also less rigorous than I would like, pushing them down the chain.

The professor constantly alluding to more complex ideas and proofs but refraining to go into detail and the tutor who was pedantic about the things he had been told to be pedantic about and nothing else made a nice pair. It's almost as if every week he was looking for a use of induction that would forget the base case, without even bothering to think about how semantic descriptions of sets are non rigourous.

I loved how the subject firstly *forced* us to firstly be there in person as we had quizzes every second week. Secondly, that it rewarded a good understanding of maths since we had to demonstrate working on the board. It would be better if it required proofs in front of the tutor instead of just writing a single line on the board and pondering to get the attendence marks. Thirdly, that the tasks were non trivial. I thought they were easy in the moment, but in retrospect it was about the hardest any type of technical assessment got, aside from the bonus questions in prog 2.

Next time make the subject content harded, make the exams larger, more frequent and more difficult, include all the theory of comp sci content and make a score of 100% inaccessible to everyone except those that are able to prove some ridiculous lemma or demonstrate extensive prior knoweledge in the subject.

## 10. Theory of Computer Science

I consider this Discrete's annoying little brother. The content featured in this subject should have been included almost entirely in Discrete like in the UNSW course. The subject should have been expanded to complexity theory and other more advanced conepts. The assignments look easy. I'm only 2 weeks into this subject, so I'm rating it prematurely. Based on Discrete.

## 11. Software Architecture

Stupid, needs to be in person. maybe bad wrap.

## 12. Business Requirmenets Modelling

Boring.

## 13. Fundamentals of Interaction Design

They say that designers get paid a ton in the industry. They say that a lot of technically competent developers shy away from the creative and subjective aspects of the job, such as design due to its difficulty. I say it's ridiculous that people need professional qualifications to decide that light blue is nicer to look at than dark blue.

In Funds UI just about the only valuable thing I learnt is that a knee-high extended rigid surface is 'sit-on-able' and I quote that shit 4 times a week.

In this class, students waste time as the PhD who can barely string together a grammatically correct sentence in English reads from the slide, occasionally varying his pace and straying from the content of the slides maybe twice over the entire hour. By the time your ten minutes of 'Assignment time' are over you would have questioned if the nintey minute trek out to the city was worth it like 8 different times.

The lectures are equally painful to sit through. It doesn't help that the lecturer is a constantly unenthused and taking breaks from the content which is dry, repetitive, and painfully common sense to talk about his latest modern art project. Although in his defense, I would also do anything I could to avoid explaining for the 18th fucking time what the Nielsen Heuristics are.

The assessments are marked so incredibly harshly. Two of my friends who have no problems writing reports or otherwise engaging in non-developer activities barely passed this subject with low 60s. I remember their warnings to us as they received their grades to take it more seriously than they did. But it is hard to! Between exams with drawing components, canva posters and possibly the worst university assignment I have done to date- a massive report, composed with a storyboard, 10 figma wireframe screens on a paper prototype, a 5 minute video of a user interacting with the app followed by a lengthy analysis of the interactiveness and a redrawing of the prototype. Keep in mind, unlike technical subjects merely completing the task is no guarantee you'll be getting decent marks. That's judged by the *quality of the report*, which is a euphemism for saying it'll be copied and pasted into Chat-GPT. The assessments will make you paranoid about things you didnt believe it was possible to be paranoid about, how big an image is when you put it on a poster.

Altogether the combination of a lack of interesting content, an insane marking criteria, and no effort from the tutor's side landed this subject the rank it did.
