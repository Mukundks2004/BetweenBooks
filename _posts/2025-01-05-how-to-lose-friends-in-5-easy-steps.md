***Do you have too many friends?***

***Are you relentlessly pestered and harrassed, asked out and never have enough time for yourself?***

***Have you done everything in your power to say no, but find yourself at parties and clubs every night?***

Well look no further, here is a short but dense guide on how to claim back your life and continue living commitment-free. This is your all-in-one guide to *shedding* your acquaintances!

## Where Did I Get This Information?

They say the only way to learn is through mistakes. I have been very fortunate in life to have been constantly surrounded by people that have generously and selflessly made mistakes for me.

If you cut them off and proceed to stop talking because you don't even care about what you're saying, or cut yourself off after cutting them off because you found a reason to stop talking about the super important thing that you cut your friend off for, even better.

It has a 100% success rate of working, it is super simple and hard to forget and it is clear and fast. If every party does this, there will never be any problems with meeting.

So if you are dead set on losing your friends, make sure to NOT do this. Instead, never answer the question both online and in person, always act as though everything is confusing and overcomplicate simple messages with unnecessary fluff. Bonus points if you say you are doing one thing but really you are somewhere else or doing another. Also, avoiding ETAs at all cost even if people are BEGGING for an ETA is a shortcut to getting people to hate you.

## 3. Be Unwilling to Compromise

Sure if you're married it is important to make it clear when you are hurt or upset, or when something needs to change. But friends have no business complaining endlessly about
