The greates character in the greatest sitcom


Intro

## Why Do I think Abed is great?


- he's muslim but that doesnt affect the show at all. he's muslim the same way i'm hindu
    - he doesn't want to drink but does, he is beneath his cause
    - he says as a muslim hes happy to film but not as a filmmaker
- he is a half indian half polish actor playing a half palestinian half polish character. I relate to his character
- he is robot. i don't like the trope because i dont understand it -> he is above it (he breaks out of it to play characters so maybe hes beyond me and im conditioned)
    - got hooked on abed in the psych experiment (dont like the robot stuff)
- the meta stuff, in the show people mock him for being wrong and having an incorrect worldview, like in the christmas episode
    - but as the viewers we can see that what he's saying is happening is actually happening, even if it is not to the community characters (we see in flashbacks some of that stuff didnt actually happen)
    - this makes him the only correct one
    - same with the gi joe episode
    - how he comments on what is actually happening, eg the bottle episode, he is the audience, and the episode with history teace=her and C
    - britta used to be smarter
    - gas leak episode
    - able to predict future eg jeff annie kiss
    - bad cop good cop follows annie shirley badges windbreakers (idk find something)
    - he plays the dungeon master both times, driving space ship from base station
    - wedding episode   
    - zombie movie homage
- abed episode jesus
    - glimpses of greatness but disappointed by failed ambition of reality

## good epsidoes

- mafia movie style homage with abed leading everything, combination of godfather, goodfellas the sopranos etc
- abed bucket list of college
