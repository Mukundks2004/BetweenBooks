# Things I can blog about

- UTS vs UNSW vs USYD comp Sci + choosing a uni, factors to consider, my experiences
- Why I code
- Who am I
- Teaching as a noble act
- Picking a team work/uni

# Type Theory Series

- how it is useful

  - what is a formal specification
  - writing and verifying a formal specification (abstractly, what does it entail, what is a spec, what are requirements)
  - proving leftpad- first spec then proof
  - applications of this (hardware spec, nasa, idk look use cases up)

  - ideally should finish the hott game before doing part 2 and 3 (need to know how modeling and non equal equivalences work)
  - also HoTT book
  - ideally even awodey cat theory book

- what is HoTT (mathematical background for first HoTT program)

  - "we are going to model homotopy theory"
  - what is homotopy theory (continuous deformations, paths and loops in a topological space)
  - spaces are types, terms are points in that space, equality is a path and there is a path space/identity type etc

  - what does it mean for TT to model something (the problem with GTT)
  - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3967700/in-what-sense-does-homotopy-type-theory-model-types-as-spaces
  - what is univalence, infinity groupoids, why does HoTT work
  - anything about denotational semantics would come here

  - let us prove a result within it, some background
  - what is a group
  - what is the fundamental group of a space e.g. circle, sphere, torus
  - conclude with "we are proving the fundamental group of S1 is isomoprhic to Z"

- first HoTT program
  - getting set up (instructions to install agda and cubical)
  - the program: proving the fundamental group of S1 is isomoprhic to Z
