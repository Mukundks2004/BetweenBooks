My name is Mukund. At the time of writing, I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of Technology Sydney, and a software cadet at WiseTech Global. Many times, various people have asked me about Uni and Work related stuff, be it the contents of a Computer Science course, what it is like working as a junior dev, juggling work and Uni, choosing a University to study at, the list goes on. While this blog isn't exactly a direct substitute, there comes a point when answering the same questions over and over where you are encouraged to step back and examine the contents of your responses holistically, and make sure your thoughts are gathered and answers are consistent. I've never written a blog before, I haven't written for leisure in years. It'll get better and less paragraphy over time.

## Why a Blog?

A post here is as much for me as it is for aspiring students out there, both at the highschool and undergraduate level, as writing is one of the best forms of therapy. It is also the time of year when people are preparing for the future, typically Uni graduates applying for jobs, highschoolers choosing a degree or even other students contemplating their courses and subjects. Very reasonably, people are struggling to make decisions. Reddit is a go-to for so many, but a 20 word comment is far from a comprehensive source to base essentially the trajectory of your career off. I hope that this page will grow to become a medium-sized repository of information, leaving few questions unanswered. If you ever get the chance to see me in person, most likely at a FEIT event, feel free to ask me about anything I write here, and in general don't shy away from asking for advice. Lack of information should never be the deciding factor in making a decision.

## About Me

I went to primary and highschool in southwest Sydney and sat my HSC in 2022. I was always a 'STEM kid' and did math, physics, chem, that stuff. My favourite classes over the years were GPIO which consisted of programming arduinos, IST which involved things like robotics and coding challenges, and Engineering studies where my friends and I exploded things, shorted things, set things on fire, spray painted, 3D printed and had lots of fun. I loved maths and participated in lots of fun competitions and events from primary through highschool. I started programming in Python when I was 14 and expanded to C and then C++ when I was 16, though I never breached the beginner level until I started at UTS. I've tried to stay in touch with maths after graduating although it's hard to keep up with my friends pursuing Mathematics full-time. In my spare time I play Badminton and Chess, read fantasy, collect coins and run a lot.

## What Can You Expect Here?

I aim to post about various aspects of the workplace and university, but I'm really not qualified as a guide in any way. I've had my own experiences, so I'll share them. This is where I stand. Some topics I can think of right now include choosing a degree, choosing a university, why I code (and why you should too), and the benefits of teaching (for the teacher). I have strong and unorthodox opinions on lots of things, but it'll definitely stay non-political and generally lighthearted.

## Chirpy

Chirpy is the Jekyll theme I used to make my blog. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). Thank you for making this as cool as it is!
