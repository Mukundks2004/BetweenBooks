My name is Mukund. At the time of writing, I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of Technology Sydney, and a software cadet. Many times, various people have asked me about Uni and Work related stuff, like the contents of a CS course, what it is like working as a junior dev, juggling work and uni, choosing a university to study at, the list goes on. There comes a point when answering the same questions over and over where you are encouraged to step back and make sure your thoughts are gathered and answers are consistent.

## Why a Blog?

I'm trying to find closure after the slaughter that was the Advanced English HSC. I like writing because I focus when I write so I'm not thinking about other things. It is also the time of year when people are preparing for the future like graduates applying for jobs, highschoolers choosing a degree or even other uni students contemplating their courses and subjects. Very reasonably, people are struggling to make decisions. Reddit is a go-to for so many, but a 20 word comment is far from a comprehensive source to base essentially the trajectory of your career off. So maybe people will come here and find some answers? (We need a new punctuation mark which is a question mark, with a hope that the answer is yes)

## About Me

I went to primary and highschool in Southwest Sydney and sat my HSC in 2022. I was always a 'STEM kid' and did math, physics, chem, that stuff. My favourite classes over the years were GPIO which was all about programming arduinos, IST which involved things like robotics and coding challenges, and Engineering studies where my friends and I exploded things, shorted things, set things on fire, spray painted, 3D printed and had lots of fun.

I loved maths and participated in lots of fun competitions and events through my entire schooling. I started programming in Python when I was 14 and expanded to C and then C++ when I was 16, though I never breached the beginner level until I started at UTS. I've tried to stay in touch with maths after graduating although it's hard to keep up with my friends pursuing Mathematics full-time. In my spare time I play Badminton and Chess, read fantasy, collect coins and run a lot.

## What Can You Expect Here?

I aim to post about various aspects of the workplace and university. This is the furthest thing from a guide, but I've had my own experiences and I'll share them. Some topics I can think of right now include choosing a degree, choosing a university, why I code (and why you should too), and the benefits of teaching (for the teacher). But I don't want to be basic, I'll only write if there's something to be said. I have strong and unorthodox opinions on lots of things, but I will definitely stay non-political and generally keep things lighthearted.

## Chirpy

Chirpy is the Jekyll theme I used to make my blog. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). Thank you, Cotes, for making this look as cool as it does!
