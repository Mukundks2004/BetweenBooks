My name is Mukund. At the time of writing, I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of Technology Sydney, and a software cadet at WiseTech Global. Many times, various people have asked me about so many different parts of my experience, be it the contents of a Computer Science course, what it is like working as a developer, juggling work and Uni, choosing a University to study, the list goes on. While this blog isn't exactly a direct substitute, there comes a point when answering the same questions over and over where you are encouraged to step back and examine the contents of your responses wholistically, and make sure your thoughts are gathered. I've never written a blog before, I haven't written for leisure in years. It'll get better and less paragraphy over time.

## Why a Blog?

A post here is as much for me as it is for aspiring students out there, both at the highschool and undergraduate level, as my brain is a bit scrambled right now and writing is one of the best forms of therapy. It is also the time of year when many students are receiving offers themselves to become cadets, and very reasonably are struggling to make a decision (why are they hesitating and not going for it? Surprisingly, there are valid reasons to reject an offer, and I'll write about some of them). Reddit is a go-to for so many, but a 20 word comment is far from a wholistic and trustworthy source to base essentially the trajectory of your career off. I hope that this page will grow to become a huge repository of information, leaving few questions unanswered. If you ever get the chance to see me in person, most likely at a FEIT event, feel free to ask me about *anything* that might be bugging you. Lack of information should never be the deciding factor in making a decision.

## About Me

I went to primary and highschool in southwest Sydney and sat my HSC in 2022. I was always a 'STEM kid' and did subjects such as Maths, Physics and Chemistry. My favourite classes over the years were GPIO which consisted of programming arduinos, IST which involved things like robotics and coding challenges, and Engineering studies where my friends and I exploded things, shorted things, set things on fire, spray painted, 3D printed and had lots of fun. I loved maths and participated in a range of maths competitions from primary through highschool. I started programming in Python when I was 14 and expanded to C and then C++ when I was 16, though I was never very good at it. I've tried to stay in touch with Math after graduating although it's hard to keep up with my friends pursuing Mathematics at University. In my spare time I play Badminton and chess, read fantasy, collect coins and run!

## What Can You Expect Here?

I aim to post about various aspects of the workplace and university, but I'm really not qualified as a guide in any way. I've had my own experiences, so I'll share them. This is where I stand. Some topics I can think of right now include choosing a degree, choosing a university, why I code (and why you should too), and the benefits of teaching (for the teacher). Also, it's my blog so anything else I want haha.
