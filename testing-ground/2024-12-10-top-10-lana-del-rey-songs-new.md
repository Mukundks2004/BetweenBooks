I know a LOT about Lana Del Rey.

Call it what you want from interested to captivated to obsessed but I've been following her music since I was 15, constantly waiting for releases and looping classics. And after all this time, I want to do something meaningful with my understanding and experience in this essentially pointless field of study. I have both the technical know-how and thorough, examinable knowledge of her discography as well as the natural intuition and feel for her style that one builds over a number of years of regular consumption of any artist's work. 

In this article I hope to use my powers for good, to recommend to you the right approach (in this case the right songs) to get to know Lana *like I do*. That last part is important! There's a number of ways to appreciate her music, from the tragic overplayed classics people reductively coin "white girl tunes" to the tiktok hardstyle remixes that are consumed en masse unknowingly by the large portion of the public that doomscrolls. All of these are valid ways to categorize classes of successful songs and to attempt to isolate a single aesthetic (like a spectral decomposition of white light into many colours), and there is significant overlap. But this is *my* POV, and why *I* like her- it's extremely well thought out, deliberate and will deliver on what it promises to. Here is how to meet and enjoy the best of Lana my way. This list will be heavily biased towards her earlier years, because her earlier works are better. I'll explore why in another article. 

This list will *not* include *Say Yes to Heaven* (which has grown super popular recently) or *Video Games* (considered a cult classic by many) and many other big hits of her career. There is a correlation between streams and ranking, but it's not a direct one to one. Why did I include unreleased songs? A secret is only a secret for as long as it's known by one person and Lana has long since parted with her exclusive hold on her unreleased masterpieces. I don't live and die by the producers.

# 10. Brooklyn Baby ![ultraviolence album cover](/assets/img/ultraviolence_preview.jpg){: .right}

*They judge me like a picture book, by the colours like they forgot to read*

The lyric above is an original, although it was inspired by an entry in Marilyn Monroe's diary. And honestly, I can't think of a better lyric to capture the song, or a better song to capture Lana. When you think of quintessential Lana, you think of 50s and 60s Americana, of vivid visual imagery and of lyrics that are better described as poetry than pop music, you think of *this song*. A fan favourite though not big enough for the out-group to recognize, I can think of no better song to start with as I have the energy and drive to give a good analysis and we're not yet at the level where my comments are super tailored to my interests, most of what I claim can be reasonably described as popular opinion.

*Brooklyn Baby* retells a classic story, the young girl who is shunned and rejected for seeking romance with her older boyfriend. Lana has already explored this trope in *Lolita*, *Off to the Races* and others. The 'Baby' part comes from Lana's submission as a female to her boyfriend, infanticizing herself to give her bf more power over her. I think what makes this version different is how *earnest* and committed the singer is. She pines for her lover and laments how she has been cast aside by society, her tone is nothing but lonely and longing. The Db major scale is composed in the lydian mode. The lydian mode is pretty rare, you see it in jazz or experimental music, which makes it all the more on-theme.

The meta to *Brooklyn Baby* is spread across two layers- most simply it is a testimony to Lana's love for beat poetry, amphetamines and the jazz culture. All things Brooklyn, since it's considered the weirdest and artsiest of the NYC boroughs and it was where Lana spent a lot of her earlier years. When you take a step back, it starts to become clear that the song is a satire though. It pokes fun at the hipster culture, and about becoming a hipster in the 2010s
