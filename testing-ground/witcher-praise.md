# And Then It Was Over??

Readers love to make distinctions between phrasings even when there are none to be made, for no reason other than to be overly pedantic and contrarian. As a reader myself, I must make it known that I consider "The best book ever made", "The best book series ever made", "The best book ever written", "My favourite book" and "The book I enjoyed the most" to be completely different questions. Partially so I can do justice to many books I find worthy of praise and not have to bear the burden of having to making a choice. If you put a gun to my head and insisted the questions were all one and the same, the Witcher would come out on top.
