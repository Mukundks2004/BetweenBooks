I know *very* little about Taylor Swift.

If you could divide my blog posts into those I am safely qualified to talk about and those I am not, this post would be the sole occupant of the latter. While I don't have the authority to make big claims about Taylor's life, her influences or how many times she's topped the charts, neither do most people. And that doesn't stop them from mass-producing reels and tweets and stories praising her. And it's more fun, and probably a more inviting topic for most people compared to maths so maybe I don't have to take myself so seriously this time.
