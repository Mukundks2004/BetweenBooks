I know a LOT about Lana Del Rey.

Call it what you want from interested to captivated to obsessed but I've been following her music since I was 15, constantly waiting for releases and looping classics. And after all this time, I want to do something meaningful with my understanding and experience in this essentially pointless field of study. I have both the technical know-how and thorough, examinable knowledge of her discography as well as the natural intuition and feel for her style that one builds over a number of years of regular consumption of any artist's work. 

In this article I hope to use my powers for good, to recommend to you the right approach (in this case the right songs) to get to know Lana *like I do*. That last part is important! There's a number of ways to appreciate her music, from the tragic overplayed classics people reductively coin "white girl tunes" to the tiktok hardstyle remixes that are consumed en masse unknowingly by the large portion of the public that doomscrolls. All of these are valid ways to categorize classes of successful songs and to attempt to isolate a single aesthetic (like a spectral decomposition of white light into many colours), and there is significant overlap. But this is *my* POV, and why *I* like her- it's extremely well thought out, deliberate and will deliver on what it promises to. Here is how to meet and enjoy the best of Lana my way. This list will be heavily biased towards her earlier years, because her earlier works are better. I'll explore why in another article. 

This list will *not* include *Say Yes to Heaven* (which has grown super popular recently) or *Video Games* (considered a cult classic by many) and many other big hits of her career. There is a correlation between streams and ranking, but it's not a direct one to one. This list *will* include unreleased songs, because a secret is only a secret for as long as it's known by one person and Lana has long since parted with her exclusive hold on her unreleased masterpieces.

# 10. Brooklyn Baby
*They judge me like a picture book, by the colours like they forgot to read*

# 9. Radio
*Now my life is sweet like cinnamon, like a fuckin' dream I'm living in, baby love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio*

# 8. Pretty When I Cry
*Don't say you need me when, you leave and you leave again, I'm stronger than all my men- except for you.*

# 7. Dark Paradise
*And there's no remedy for memory your face is like a memory, it won't leave my head*

# 6. Summertime Sadness (Yes, That One)
*I'm feeling electric tonight cruising down the coast going bout '99, got my bad baby by my heavenly side, I know if I go I'll die happy tonight*

# 5. Queen of Disaster
*Got mascara thick I get emotional, you knew I was more than just a party girl, is it hard to see what's going on, I'm so far gone*

# 4. Young and Beautiful
*Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?*

# 3. Jealous Girl
*Baby I'm a gangsta too and it takes two to tango, you don't wanna dance with me, dance with me*

# 2. Born to Die
*Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?*

# 1. Cherry
*Darling, darling, darling, I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces. My cherries and wine. Rosemary and thyme.*
